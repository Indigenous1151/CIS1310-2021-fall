                        The <strong>Pontiac Firebird</strong> is an American automobile that was built and produced by Pontiac from the 1967 
                        to 2002 model years. Designed as a pony car to compete with the Ford Mustang, it was introduced on February 
                        23, 1967, five months after GM's Chevrolet division's platform-sharing Camaro. This also coincided with the 
                        release of the 1967 Mercury Cougar, Ford's upscale, platform-sharing version of the Mustang.<br>

                        The name "Firebird" was also previously used by GM for the General Motors Firebird in the 1950s and early 
                        1960s concept cars.<br>
